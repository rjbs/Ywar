# Ywar - be aware

Ywar is a set of tools for automating my use of [The Daily
Practice](http://tdp.me/) and [Remember the Milk](http://rememberthemilk.com/).
It updates many of my daily goals and produces a daily agenda telling me which
tasks must be today, tomorrow, and for the next few days.

You can't just run Ywar yourself, because it's really, really tied to my goals,
but it has a lot of code you might want to rip out and re-use.
